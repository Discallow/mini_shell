About the Project
Minishell is a simplified, custom shell implementation created as part of the curriculum at 42 School. The goal of this project is to understand how a basic UNIX shell operates and to gain experience in building a command interpreter from scratch. This project is written in C and focuses on process management, input parsing, and executing commands using system calls.

This project adheres to the norms and requirements of the 42 School's "Minishell" project.

Features
Minishell includes the following key features:

Prompt display: Shows a prompt waiting for user input.
Execution of commands: Handles external commands by searching through $PATH and forking processes.
Built-in commands: Implements several built-in shell commands like echo, cd, pwd, export, unset, env, and exit.
Redirections: Supports input and output redirection using > (output redirection), >> (append), and < (input redirection).
Pipes: Executes commands in sequence while passing output from one to another using pipes (|).
Environment Variables: Handles environment variable expansion with $.
Signals: Manages signals like Ctrl-C, Ctrl-D, and Ctrl-\ to mimic the behavior of a typical shell.
Error Handling: Provides meaningful error messages and handles common shell errors gracefully.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
To run the minishell project, you'll need:

A Unix-like environment (Linux or macOS)
GCC or another C compiler
The make utility
Basic knowledge of how shells and system calls work
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copiar código
git clone https://github.com/your-username/minishell.git
cd minishell
Compile the project:

bash
Copiar código
make
Run the shell:

bash
Copiar código
./minishell
Usage
Once you’ve started minishell, you can type commands just like in a normal shell. The prompt will appear, and you can type built-in or external commands.

Example:

bash
Copiar código
$ ls -l
$ cd ..
$ echo "Hello, Minishell"
$ cat file.txt | grep pattern
Supported Built-in Commands
echo: Print arguments to the standard output.
Usage: echo [-n] [string ...]
cd: Change the current directory.
Usage: cd [directory]
pwd: Print the current directory.
Usage: pwd
export: Set environment variables.
Usage: export VAR=value
unset: Remove environment variables.
Usage: unset VAR
env: Display environment variables.
Usage: env
exit: Exit the shell.
Usage: exit [exit_code]
External Commands
Minishell supports external commands found in the system's $PATH. For example:

bash
Copiar código
$ ls
$ grep
$ wc
$ cat
You can also combine them with redirections and pipes.

Redirections and Pipes
Redirect output: >, >>
Redirect input: <
Use pipes: |
Example:

bash
Copiar código
$ cat file.txt | grep search_term > result.txt
Error Handling
Minishell provides error messages when:

A command is not found.
Incorrect arguments are provided to a built-in command.
Redirections or pipes fail.
Invalid syntax is used (e.g., unclosed quotes, incorrect redirection).
For example:

bash
Copiar código
$ ls | | grep
minishell: syntax error near unexpected token `|'
Resources
For this project, I referred to the following resources:

UNIX system calls: Documentation on fork(), execve(), waitpid(), pipe(), and other system calls.
The 42 Project Subject: The official guidelines and rules of the Minishell project.
GNU Bash Manual: To understand how typical shell features behave.

Conclusion
Minishell was an exciting and challenging project, and it helped deepen my understanding of how shells work under the hood, from command execution and process handling to signal management and input/output redirection.

Feel free to open issues or pull requests if you find any bugs or have suggestions for improvements!

This README is a comprehensive guide for anyone who wants to understand how your shell works and how to use it. Adapt it to your specific implementation and any additional features you might have included!
